# NaiveBayes
This code performs a classification task on the "adult.csv" dataset, aiming to predict whether an individual's income is above or below $50K. It begins by importing necessary libraries, loading the data, renaming the columns for better readability, and then explores the data to understand its structure and content. Categorical variables are identified, and their value counts are analyzed. Missing values, initially represented as "?", are replaced with NaN, then imputed with the mode of each respective column. Categorical features are then one-hot encoded to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Feature scaling is applied using RobustScaler to handle outliers. Finally, a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the processed training data, and its performance is evaluated on the test data using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. The model's accuracy is also compared against the null accuracy to assess its effectiveness.
